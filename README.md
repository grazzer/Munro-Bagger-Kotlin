Munro Bagger is an Kotlin application, for walkers to log their assents of the 282 scottish munros (mountians). The application provides a searchable list of munros, that display the munros name location and height. 

Progress was stopped on this project and the application was recreated using React Native (Munro-Bagger-React).
